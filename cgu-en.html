The data collected is processed by The MARS. Company.<br>
MARS. is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of your privacy. This privacy policy (along with our document on the use of cookies and our terms of service and any other document that references it) is meant to inform you on the way we process the personal data you share with us and that we collect when you use the Application and Services. We invite you to carefully read this document to better understand how we process your personal data, and to know your rights.
This Privacy Policy is applicable to all Services created by MARS. that you use (with the exception of services supplied and operated by third parties, in which case, their privacy policy applies).

<h2>6.2 The information we collect</h2>
Your use of our Services makes it likely that we collect and process data necessary to the proper functioning of the Application and to the supply of the Services. It can be information you share with us directly, or data we collect automatically.

<h2>6.2.1 Data you share directly </h2>
<p>When you use our Services, you are required to share some information, some of which may serve to identify you. When you communicate this information, you accept that some of it will be visible to the other Members of the Application, and therefore be made public on the Application. In an effort to help you identify this information easily, it is signaled as “public” below. MARS. cannot be held liable for data published on its platform and disclosed by a Member. However, the information not marked as Public will not be visible or accessible by other Members.</p>

The information you share contains the following data:

<p>Registration data: this is the basic data that is necessary for you to register and access our Services. This data is collected by MARS. from Facebook and Google, via Facebook Connect and Google Sign-in to simplify the process. When you click on “Facebook Connect” or “Google Sing-in” you let Facebook or Google share this data with us. This identity data is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your photo (public): this is, at least, your public Facebook / Gmail profile picture. You then have the option of removing this photo and/or adding other photos to your Account from your Facebook / Gmail account.</li>
<li>Your birthdate (private): only your age, as deducted from the birthday, will be visible to other members (Facebook). </li>
<li>Your first and last name (public)</li>
<li>His email address (not visible to “MARS.”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing this information is mandatory. If you do not share it, MARS. will not be able to supply the Services offered in the Application and you will not be able to create an account.</p>

<p>Data on your interactions with “MARS.”: we may ask you to share, or you may be in a situation where you need to give us information, for example when you contact our customer or support services, report an issue with our services, ask for help, exercise your personal data rights, or participate in a promo, game, contest, raffle, or survey, when you share your experience with our services, give testimonies, or answer one of our questionnaires.</p>

<h2>6.2.2 Data we collect automatically</h2>
When you use our services and features, we collect information regarding your activity on the Application:

<p>Location Data (geolocation): the Application’s main value and purpose is to allow Members to find and contact Members who have the same wishes and activities and who are in the same area in order to Meet-up for personal and recreational purposes. You will be asked to authorize the collection and processing of your location data to allow MARS. to identify your location with other Members who agreed to be geolocated. The location let MARS. show you Badges of Members who meet your wishes and activities.</p>

<p>MARS. does not recreate the movements and/or itineraries of its Members, and would like to remind you that it only keeps crossing locations between Members. The exact position or the itinerary of a Member is never available to the other Members.</p>

<p>You are free to withdraw your consent at any time and disable your smartphone’s geolocation option. If you choose to do so, you will no longer have access to the  Badges of Members.</p>

<p>Transaction Data: MARS. does not collect or process any bank data. Apple’s App Store has opted to refrain from sending certain types data to mobile applications, which includes any banking and financial information. This data is collected and processed solely by the above platforms, and MARS. does not have the option of changing this payment method. The only information exchanged between MARS. and Apple’s App Store is technical data that doesn’t allow us to identify you (for example, a transaction number), which serves to confirm transactions.</p>

<p>Data on the use of the messaging service: sent messages are stored on MARS’s servers exclusively, to provide the Service to allow Members having a common wish or activity to have a conversation. Those conversations are deleted after 48 hours. Messages are strictly private and only implicate the Members involved. Additionally, Messages are strictly private and are not accessible to other Members not involved in the conversation, nor to any third party.</p>

<p>Device and equipment data: we collect information from the devices and equipment you use to access our Services, including server logs, which may contain information like IP addresses, version of the application, mobile model, mobile ID, language used, operating system, application crashes, and advertisement ID.
